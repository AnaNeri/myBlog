    "body": "A quantum particle can be state 0 (ground), or state 1 (excited), or both ate the same time (superposition state). It is not deterministic. A qubit can be, for instance, a light particle - photon - or a spin of an atom.\n When the state of the qubit is measured it collapses to 0 or 1. In other words, reading the state makes the state lose its information."
