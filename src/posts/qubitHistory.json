    "body": ["Once upon a time, there was a wild fight started because of the intriguing question: \"what is light?\".","It was 1672 when Newton presented to the world his theory of light. In it, Newton explains that light consists of particles. On the opposite side of this battlefield, fellow researchers like Hooke and Huygens criticize Newton's light theory and favor the wave theory for light.","After some experiments rejecting Newton's theory, the dramatic debate settled for a while.","However, nature is full of astonishing surprises, and the photoelectric effect led the world to the conclusion that light is not a wave.","Therefore, both sides were wrong. Light is neither particles, neither waves.","Einstein decided to solve the problem and say:","\"If we can prove it is not a particle and if we can prove it is not a wave, maybe to some extent it is both! Wellcome the wave-particle concept!\"","Then, he explained it mathematically, won the noble of physics (1921), complained about this silly theory until his last day, and we have been pretending to get it. Nevertheless, the quantum mechanics theory is working, growing, and solidifying.","At the beginning of the crazy 80s, Feynman pushes the limits further and speculated that the relation of physics and computation should not stop in classical physics.","Nowadays, the vision of Feynman seems closer to reality.","How exactly, you may ask. Well, now we got the qubit."]
